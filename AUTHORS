## Exceptions with third-party libraries
The third-party libraries have their own way of addressing authorship, and the authorship of commits importing/updating
a third-party library reflects who did the importing instead of who wrote the code within the commit.

The Authors of third-party libraries are not explicitly mentioned, and usually is possible to obtain from the files belonging to the third-party libraries.

## Cross-project collaboration

At AzerothCore, we actively promote collaboration with other MaNGOS-based open-source projects that are actively maintained. This also includes cherry-picking commits from relevant projects such as:

* TrinityCore: https://github.com/trinitycore
* CMaNGOS: https://github.com/cmangos/
* vMaNGOS: https://github.com/vmangos
* and others

It is strictly required for any contributor importing code to credit the original author by:
- linking the original PR (or commit)
- adding a [Co-authored-by](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) line in the PR description

This will automatically include the original author in our list of [Contributors](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/graphs/contributors).

If you notice a violation of the above, please report it to the Staff immediately.

We encourage other projects to adopt similar practices to promote healthy cross-project collaboration and proper attribution.
