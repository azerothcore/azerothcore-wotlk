6.0.0 - TBD
-----------

* Floating-point formatting is now locale-independent:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <locale>
     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
       fmt::print("value = {}", 4.2);
     }

  prints "value = 4.2" regardless of the locale.

  For locale-specific formatting use the ``n`` specifier:

  .. code:: c++

     std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
     fmt::print("value = {:n}", 4.2);

  prints "value = 4,2".

* Added an experimental Grisu floating-point formatting algorithm
  implementation (disabled by default). To enable it define ``FMT_USE_GRISU``
  macro to 1 before including ``fmt/format.h``:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_USE_GRISU 1
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     auto s = fmt::format("{}", 4.2); // formats 4.2 using Grisu

  With Grisu enabled, {fmt} is 13x faster than ``std::ostringstream`` (libc++)
  and 10x faster than ``sprintf`` on the `dtoa-benchmark
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark>`_ floating-point formatting
  benchmark:

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             54883977-9fe8c000-4e28-11e9-8bde-272d122e7c52.jpg

  `Full benchmark results <https://fmt.dev/unknown_mac64_clang10.0.html>`_

* ``formatter`` specializations now always take precedence over ``operator<<``
  (`#952 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/952>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <iostream>
     #include <fmt/ostream.h>

     struct S {};

     std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, S) {
       return os << 1;
     }

     template <>
     struct fmt::formatter<S> : fmt::formatter<int> {
       auto format(S, format_context& ctx) {
         return formatter<int>::format(2, ctx);
       }
     };

     int main() {
       std::cout << S() << "\n"; // prints 1 using operator<<
       fmt::print("{}\n", S());  // prints 2 using formatter
     }

* Introduced the experimental ``fmt::compile`` function that does format string
  compilation (`#618 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/618>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     auto f = fmt::compile<int>("{}");
     std::string s = fmt::format(f, 42); // can be called multiple times to format
                                         // different values
     // s == "42"

  It moves the cost of parsing a format string outside of the format function
  which can be beneficial when identically formatting many objects of the same
  types. Thanks `@stryku (Mateusz Janek) <https://github.com/stryku>`_.

* Added the ``%`` format specifier that formats floating-point values as
  percentages (`#1060 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1060>`_,
  `#1071 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1071>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{:.1%}", 0.42); // s == "42.0%"

  Thanks `@gawain-bolton (Gawain Bolton) <https://github.com/gawain-bolton>`_:

* Implemented precision for floating-point durations
  (`#1004 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1004>`_,
  `#1012 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1012>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{:.1}", std::chrono::duration<double>(1.234));
     // s == 1.2s

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Implemented ``chrono`` format specifiers ``%Q`` and ``%q`` that give the value
  and the unit respectively (`#1019 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1019>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto value = fmt::format("{:%Q}", 42s); // value == "42"
     auto unit  = fmt::format("{:%q}", 42s); // unit == "s"

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Fixed handling of dynamic width in chrono formatter:

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{0:{1}%H:%M:%S}", std::chrono::seconds(12345), 12);
     //                        ^ width argument index                     ^ width
     // s == "03:25:45    "

  Thanks Howard Hinnant.

* Removed deprecated ``fmt/time.h``. Use ``fmt/chrono.h`` instead.

* Added ``fmt::format`` and ``fmt::vformat`` overloads that take ``text_style``
  (`#993 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/993>`_,
  `#994 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/994>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     std::string message = fmt::format(fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),
                                       "The answer is {}.", 42);

  Thanks `@Naios (Denis Blank) <https://github.com/Naios>`_.

* Made ``std::unique_ptr`` and ``std::shared_ptr`` formattable as pointers via
  ``fmt::ptr``:

  .. code:: c++

     std::unique_ptr<int> p = ...;
     fmt::print("{}", fmt::ptr(p)); // prints p as a pointer

* Made ``print`` and ``vprint`` report I/O errors
  (`#1098 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1098>`_,
  `#1099 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1099>`_).
  Thanks `@BillyDonahue (Billy Donahue) <https://github.com/BillyDonahue>`_.

* Separated formatting and parsing contexts, removing the undocumented
  ``basic_format_context::parse_context()`` function.

* Marked deprecated APIs with the ``[[deprecated]]`` attribute and removed
  internal uses of deprecated APIs
  (`#1022 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1022>`_).
  Thanks `@eliaskosunen (Elias Kosunen) <https://github.com/eliaskosunen>`_.

* Moved the undocumented ``basic_writer``, ``writer``, and ``wwriter`` types
  to the ``internal`` namespace.

* Moved SFINAE to template parameters to reduce symbol sizes.

* Added support for exotic platforms without ``uintptr_t`` such as IBM i
  (AS/400) with 128-bit pointers and only 64-bit integers
  (`#1059 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1059>`_).

* Stopped setting ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` if {fmt} is a subproject
  (`#1081 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1081>`_).

* Added `Sublime Text syntax highlighting config
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/support/C%2B%2B.sublime-syntax>`_
  (`#1037 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1037>`_).

5.3.0 - 2018-12-28
------------------

* Introduced experimental chrono formatting support:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;
       fmt::print("Default format: {} {}\n", 42s, 100ms);
       fmt::print("strftime-like format: {:%H:%M:%S}\n", 3h + 15min + 30s);
     }

  prints::

     Default format: 42s 100ms
     strftime-like format: 03:15:30

* Added experimental support for emphasis (bold, italic, underline,
  strikethrough), colored output to a file stream, and improved colored
  formatting API
  (`#961 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/961>`_,
  `#967 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/967>`_,
  `#973 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/973>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       print(fg(fmt::color::crimson) | fmt::emphasis::bold,
             "Hello, {}!\n", "world");
       print(fg(fmt::color::floral_white) | bg(fmt::color::slate_gray) |
             fmt::emphasis::underline, "Hello, {}!\n", "мир");
       print(fg(fmt::color::steel_blue) | fmt::emphasis::italic,
             "Hello, {}!\n", "世界");
     }

  prints the following on modern terminals with RGB color support:

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             50405788-b66e7500-076e-11e9-9592-7324d1f951d8.png

  Thanks `@Rakete1111 (Nicolas) <https://github.com/Rakete1111>`_.

* Added support for 4-bit terminal colors
  (`#968 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/968>`_,
  `#974 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/974>`_)

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       print(fg(fmt::terminal_color::red), "stop\n");
     }

  Note that these colors vary by terminal:

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             50405925-dbfc7e00-0770-11e9-9b85-333fab0af9ac.png

  Thanks `@Rakete1111 (Nicolas) <https://github.com/Rakete1111>`_.

* Parameterized formatting functions on the type of the format string
  (`#880 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/880>`_,
  `#881 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/881>`_,
  `#883 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/883>`_,
  `#885 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/885>`_,
  `#897 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/897>`_,
  `#920 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/920>`_).
  Any object of type ``S`` that has an overloaded ``to_string_view(const S&)``
  returning ``fmt::string_view`` can be used as a format string:

  .. code:: c++

     namespace my_ns {
     inline string_view to_string_view(const my_string& s) {
       return {s.data(), s.length()};
     }
     }

     std::string message = fmt::format(my_string("The answer is {}."), 42);

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Made ``std::string_view`` work as a format string
  (`#898 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/898>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto message = fmt::format(std::string_view("The answer is {}."), 42);

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Added wide string support to compile-time format string checks
  (`#924 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/924>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     print(fmt(L"{:f}"), 42); // compile-time error: invalid type specifier

  Thanks `@XZiar <https://github.com/XZiar>`_.

* Made colored print functions work with wide strings
  (`#867 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/867>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {

     }

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Introduced experimental Unicode support
  (`#628 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/628>`_,
  `#891 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/891>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     using namespace fmt::literals;
     auto s = fmt::format("{:*^5}"_u, "🤡"_u); // s == "**🤡**"_u

* Improved locale support:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/locale.h>

     struct numpunct : std::numpunct<char> {
      protected:
       char do_thousands_sep() const override { return '~'; }
     };

     std::locale loc;
     auto s = fmt::format(std::locale(loc, new numpunct()), "{:n}", 1234567);
     // s == "1~234~567"

* Constrained formatting functions on proper iterator types
  (`#921 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/921>`_).
  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Added ``make_printf_args`` and ``make_wprintf_args`` functions
  (`#934 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/934>`_).
  Thanks `@tnovotny <https://github.com/tnovotny>`_.

* Deprecated ``fmt::visit``, ``parse_context``, and ``wparse_context``.
  Use ``fmt::visit_format_arg``, ``format_parse_context``, and
  ``wformat_parse_context`` instead.

* Removed undocumented ``basic_fixed_buffer`` which has been superseded by the
  iterator-based API
  (`#873 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/873>`_,
  `#902 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/902>`_).
  Thanks `@superfunc (hollywood programmer) <https://github.com/superfunc>`_.

* Disallowed repeated leading zeros in an argument ID:

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{000}", 42); // error

* Reintroduced support for gcc 4.4.

* Fixed compilation on platforms with exotic ``double``
  (`#878 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/878>`_).

5.2.1 - 2018-09-21
------------------

* Fixed ``visit`` lookup issues on gcc 7 & 8
  (`#870 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/870>`_).
  Thanks `@medithe <https://github.com/medithe>`_.

* Fixed linkage errors on older gcc.

* Prevented ``fmt/range.h`` from specializing ``fmt::basic_string_view``
  (`#865 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/865>`_,
  `#868 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/868>`_).
  Thanks `@hhggit (dual) <https://github.com/hhggit>`_.

* Improved error message when formatting unknown types
  (`#872 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/872>`_).
  Thanks `@foonathan (Jonathan Müller) <https://github.com/foonathan>`_,

* Disabled templated user-defined literals when compiled under nvcc
  (`#875 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/875>`_).
  Thanks `@CandyGumdrop (Candy Gumdrop) <https://github.com/CandyGumdrop>`_,

* Fixed ``format_to`` formatting to ``wmemory_buffer``
  (`#874 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/874>`_).

5.2.0 - 2018-09-13
------------------

* Optimized format string parsing and argument processing which resulted in up
  to 5x speed up on long format strings and significant performance boost on
  various benchmarks. For example, version 5.2 is 2.22x faster than 5.1 on
  decimal integer formatting with ``format_to`` (macOS, clang-902.0.39.2):

  ==================  =======  =======
  Method              Time, s  Speedup
  ==================  =======  =======
  fmt::format 5.1      0.58
  fmt::format 5.2      0.35     1.66x
  fmt::format_to 5.1   0.51
  fmt::format_to 5.2   0.23     2.22x
  sprintf              0.71
  std::to_string       1.01
  std::stringstream    1.73
  ==================  =======  =======

* Changed the ``fmt`` macro from opt-out to opt-in to prevent name collisions.
  To enable it define the ``FMT_STRING_ALIAS`` macro to 1 before including
  ``fmt/format.h``:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_STRING_ALIAS 1
     #include <fmt/format.h>
     std::string answer = format(fmt("{}"), 42);

* Added compile-time format string checks to ``format_to`` overload that takes
  ``fmt::memory_buffer`` (`#783 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/783>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::memory_buffer buf;
     // Compile-time error: invalid type specifier.
     fmt::format_to(buf, fmt("{:d}"), "foo");

* Moved experimental color support to ``fmt/color.h`` and enabled the
  new API by default. The old API can be enabled by defining the
  ``FMT_DEPRECATED_COLORS`` macro.

* Added formatting support for types explicitly convertible to
  ``fmt::string_view``:

  .. code:: c++

     struct foo {
       explicit operator fmt::string_view() const { return "foo"; }
     };
     auto s = format("{}", foo());

  In particular, this makes formatting function work with
  ``folly::StringPiece``.

* Implemented preliminary support for ``char*_t`` by replacing the ``format``
  function overloads with a single function template parameterized on the string
  type.

* Added support for dynamic argument lists
  (`#814 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/814>`_,
  `#819 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/819>`_).
  Thanks `@MikePopoloski (Michael Popoloski)
  <https://github.com/MikePopoloski>`_.

* Reduced executable size overhead for embedded targets using newlib nano by
  making locale dependency optional
  (`#839 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/839>`_).
  Thanks `@teajay-fr (Thomas Benard) <https://github.com/teajay-fr>`_.

* Keep ``noexcept`` specifier when exceptions are disabled
  (`#801 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/801>`_,
  `#810 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/810>`_).
  Thanks `@qis (Alexej Harm) <https://github.com/qis>`_.

* Fixed formatting of user-defined types providing ``operator<<`` with
  ``format_to_n``
  (`#806 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/806>`_).
  Thanks `@mkurdej (Marek Kurdej) <https://github.com/mkurdej>`_.

* Fixed dynamic linkage of new symbols
  (`#808 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/808>`_).

* Fixed global initialization issue
  (`#807 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/807>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     // This works on compilers with constexpr support.
     static const std::string answer = fmt::format("{}", 42);

* Fixed various compiler warnings and errors
  (`#804 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/804>`_,
  `#809 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/809>`_,
  `#811 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/811>`_,

  `#852 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/852>`_,

  Thanks `@henryiii (Henry Schreiner) <https://github.com/henryiii>`_,
  `@medithe <https://github.com/medithe>`_, and
  `@eliasdaler (Elias Daler) <https://github.com/eliasdaler>`_.

5.1.0 - 2018-07-05
------------------

* Added experimental support for RGB color output enabled with
  the ``FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS`` macro:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS
     #define FMT_HEADER_ONLY // or compile fmt with FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS defined
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     fmt::print(fmt::color::steel_blue, "Some beautiful text");

  The old API (the ``print_colored`` and ``vprint_colored`` functions and the
  ``color`` enum) is now deprecated.
  (`#762 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/762>`_
  `#767 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/767>`_).
  thanks `@remotion (remo) <https://github.com/remotion>`_.

* Added quotes to strings in ranges and tuples
  (`#766 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/766>`_).
  Thanks `@Remotion (Remo) <https://github.com/Remotion>`_.

* Made ``format_to`` work with ``basic_memory_buffer``
  (`#776 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/776>`_).

* Added ``vformat_to_n`` and ``wchar_t`` overload of ``format_to_n``
  (`#764 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/764>`_,
  `#769 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/769>`_).

* Made ``is_range`` and ``is_tuple_like`` part of public (experimental) API
  to allow specialization for user-defined types
  (`#751 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/751>`_,
  `#759 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/759>`_).
  Thanks `@drrlvn (Dror Levin) <https://github.com/drrlvn>`_.

* Added more compilers to continuous integration and increased ``FMT_PEDANTIC``
  warning levels
  (`#736 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/736>`_).
  Thanks `@eliaskosunen (Elias Kosunen) <https://github.com/eliaskosunen>`_.

* Fixed compilation with MSVC 2013.

* Fixed handling of user-defined types in ``format_to``
  (`#793 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/793>`_).

* Forced linking of inline ``vformat`` functions into the library
  (`#795 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/795>`_).

* Fixed incorrect call to on_align in ``'{:}='``
  (`#750 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/750>`_).

* Fixed floating-point formatting to a non-back_insert_iterator with sign &
  numeric alignment specified
  (`#756 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/756>`_).

* Fixed formatting to an array with ``format_to_n``
  (`#778 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/778>`_).

* Fixed formatting of more than 15 named arguments
  (`#754 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/754>`_).

* Fixed handling of compile-time strings when including ``fmt/ostream.h``.
  (`#768 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/768>`_).

* Fixed various compiler warnings and errors
  (`#742 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/742>`_,

5.0.0 - 2018-05-21
------------------

* Added a requirement for partial C++11 support, most importantly variadic
  templates and type traits, and dropped ``FMT_VARIADIC_*`` emulation macros.
  Variadic templates are available since GCC 4.4, Clang 2.9 and MSVC 18.0 (2013).
  For older compilers use {fmt} `version 4.x
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/releases/tag/4.1.0>`_ which continues to be
  maintained and works with C++98 compilers.

* Renamed symbols to follow standard C++ naming conventions and proposed a subset
  of the library for standardization in `P0645R2 Text Formatting
  <https://wg21.link/P0645>`_.

* Implemented ``constexpr`` parsing of format strings and `compile-time format
  string checks
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#compile-time-format-string-checks>`_. For
  example

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     std::string s = format(fmt("{:d}"), "foo");

  gives a compile-time error because ``d`` is an invalid specifier for strings
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/g/rnCy9Q>`__)::

     ...
     <source>:4:19: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'fmt::v5::format<S, char [4]>' requested here
       std::string s = format(fmt("{:d}"), "foo");
                       ^
     format.h:1337:13: note: non-constexpr function 'on_error' cannot be used in a constant expression
         handler.on_error("invalid type specifier");

  Compile-time checks require relaxed ``constexpr`` (C++14 feature) support. If
  the latter is not available, checks will be performed at runtime.

* Separated format string parsing and formatting in the extension API to enable
  compile-time format string processing. For example

  .. code:: c++

     struct Answer {};

     namespace fmt {
     template <>
     struct formatter<Answer> {
       constexpr auto parse(parse_context& ctx) {
         auto it = ctx.begin();
         spec = *it;
         if (spec != 'd' && spec != 's')
           throw format_error("invalid specifier");
         return ++it;
       }

       template <typename FormatContext>
       auto format(Answer, FormatContext& ctx) {
         return spec == 's' ?
           format_to(ctx.begin(), "{}", "fourty-two") :
           format_to(ctx.begin(), "{}", 42);
       }

       char spec = 0;
     };
     }

     std::string s = format(fmt("{:x}"), Answer());

  gives a compile-time error due to invalid format specifier (`godbolt
  <https://godbolt.org/g/2jQ1Dv>`__)::

     ...
     <source>:12:45: error: expression '<throw-expression>' is not a constant expression
            throw format_error("invalid specifier");

* Added `iterator support
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#output-iterator-support>`_:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <vector>
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     std::vector<char> out;
     fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out), "{}", 42);

* Added the `format_to_n
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt11format_to_nE8OutputItNSt6size_tE11string_viewDpRK4Args>`_
  function that restricts the output to the specified number of characters
  (`#298 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/298>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     char out[4];
     fmt::format_to_n(out, sizeof(out), "{}", 12345);
     // out == "1234" (without terminating '\0')

* Added the `formatted_size
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt14formatted_sizeE11string_viewDpRK4Args>`_
  function for computing the output size:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     auto size = fmt::formatted_size("{}", 12345); // size == 5

* Improved compile times by reducing dependencies on standard headers and
  providing a lightweight `core API <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#core-api>`_:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     fmt::print("The answer is {}.", 42);

  See `Compile time and code bloat
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt#compile-time-and-code-bloat>`_.

* Added the `make_format_args
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt16make_format_argsEDpRK4Args>`_
  function for capturing formatting arguments:

  .. code:: c++
  
     // Prints formatted error message.
     void vreport_error(const char *format, fmt::format_args args) {
       fmt::print("Error: ");
       fmt::vprint(format, args);
     }
     template <typename... Args>
     void report_error(const char *format, const Args & ... args) {
       vreport_error(format, fmt::make_format_args(args...));
     }

* Added the ``make_printf_args`` function for capturing ``printf`` arguments
  (`#687 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/687>`_,
  `#694 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/694>`_).
  Thanks `@Kronuz (Germán Méndez Bravo) <https://github.com/Kronuz>`_.

* Added prefix ``v`` to non-variadic functions taking ``format_args`` to
  distinguish them from variadic ones:

  .. code:: c++

     std::string vformat(string_view format_str, format_args args);
     
     template <typename... Args>
     std::string format(string_view format_str, const Args & ... args);

* Added experimental support for formatting ranges, containers and tuple-like
  types in ``fmt/ranges.h`` (`#735 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/735>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ranges.h>

     std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
     fmt::print("{}", v); // prints {1, 2, 3}

  Thanks `@Remotion (Remo) <https://github.com/Remotion>`_.

* Implemented ``wchar_t`` date and time formatting
  (`#712 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/712>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/time.h>

     std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
     auto s = fmt::format(L"The date is {:%Y-%m-%d}.", *std::localtime(&t));

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Provided more wide string overloads
  (`#724 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/724>`_).
  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Switched from a custom null-terminated string view class to ``string_view``
  in the format API and provided ``fmt::string_view`` which implements a subset
  of ``std::string_view`` API for pre-C++17 systems.

* Added support for ``std::experimental::string_view``
  (`#607 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/607>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>
     #include <experimental/string_view>

     fmt::print("{}", std::experimental::string_view("foo"));

  Thanks `@virgiliofornazin (Virgilio Alexandre Fornazin)
  <https://github.com/virgiliofornazin>`__.

* Allowed mixing named and automatic arguments:

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::format("{} {two}", 1, fmt::arg("two", 2));

* Removed the write API in favor of the `format API
  <https://fmt.dev/dev/api.html#format-api>`_ with compile-time handling of
  format strings.

* Disallowed formatting of multibyte strings into a wide character target
  (`#606 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/606>`_).

* Improved documentation
  (`#515 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/515>`_,
  `#614 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/614>`_,
  `#617 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/617>`_,

* Implemented more efficient handling of large number of format arguments.

* Introduced an inline namespace for symbol versioning.

* Added debug postfix ``d`` to the ``fmt`` library name
  (`#636 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/636>`_).

* Removed unnecessary ``fmt/`` prefix in includes
  (`#397 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/397>`_).
  Thanks `@chronoxor (Ivan Shynkarenka) <https://github.com/chronoxor>`_.

* Moved ``fmt/*.h`` to ``include/fmt/*.h`` to prevent irrelevant files and
  directories appearing on the include search paths when fmt is used as a
  subproject and moved source files to the ``src`` directory.

* Added qmake project file ``support/fmt.pro``
  (`#641 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/641>`_).
  Thanks `@cowo78 (Giuseppe Corbelli) <https://github.com/cowo78>`_.

3.0.0 - 2016-05-07
------------------

* The project has been renamed from C++ Format (cppformat) to fmt for
  consistency with the used namespace and macro prefix
  (`#307 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/307>`_).
  Library headers are now located in the ``fmt`` directory:

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/format.h"

  Including ``format.h`` from the ``cppformat`` directory is deprecated
  but works via a proxy header which will be removed in the next major version.
  
  The documentation is now available at https://fmt.dev.

* Added support for `strftime <http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/strftime>`_-like
  `date and time formatting <https://fmt.dev/3.0.0/api.html#date-and-time-formatting>`_
  (`#283 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/283>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/time.h"

    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    // Prints "The date is 2016-04-29." (with the current date)
    fmt::print("The date is {:%Y-%m-%d}.", *std::localtime(&t));

* ``std::ostream`` support including formatting of user-defined types that provide
  overloaded ``operator<<`` has been moved to ``fmt/ostream.h``:

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/ostream.h"

    class Date {
      int year_, month_, day_;
    public:
      Date(int year, int month, int day) : year_(year), month_(month), day_(day) {}

      friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Date &d) {
        return os << d.year_ << '-' << d.month_ << '-' << d.day_;
      }
    };

    std::string s = fmt::format("The date is {}", Date(2012, 12, 9));
    // s == "The date is 2012-12-9"

* Added support for `custom argument formatters
  <https://fmt.dev/3.0.0/api.html#argument-formatters>`_
  (`#235 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/235>`_).

* Added support for locale-specific integer formatting with the ``n`` specifier
  (`#305 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/305>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    fmt::print("cppformat: {:n}\n", 1234567); // prints 1,234,567

* Sign is now preserved when formatting an integer with an incorrect ``printf``
  format specifier (`#265 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/265>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("%lld", -42); // prints -42

  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in ``std::printf``.

* Length modifiers such as ``ll`` are now optional in printf formatting
  functions and the correct type is determined automatically
  (`#255 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/255>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("%d", std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());

  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in ``std::printf``.

* Added initial support for custom formatters
  (`#231 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/231>`_).

* Fixed detection of user-defined literal support on Intel C++ compiler
  (`#311 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/311>`_,
  `#312 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/312>`_).
  Thanks to `@dean0x7d (Dean Moldovan) <https://github.com/dean0x7d>`_ and
  `@speth (Ray Speth) <https://github.com/speth>`_.

  `#173 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/173>`_,
  `#174 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/174>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::print("The answer is {answer}.", fmt::arg("answer", 42));

  Thanks to `@jamboree <https://github.com/jamboree>`_.

* [Experimental] User-defined literals for format and named arguments

  variadic templates
  (`#141 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/141>`_).
  Thanks to `@Shauren <https://github.com/Shauren>`_.

* Runtime width specification
  (`#168 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/168>`_):

  .. code:: c++

  Thanks to `@LarsGullik <https://github.com/LarsGullik>`_.

* [Breaking] ``fmt::printf`` and ``fmt::sprintf`` now print null pointers as ``(nil)``
  and null strings as ``(null)`` for consistency with glibc
  (`#226 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/226>`_).
  Thanks to `@LarsGullik <https://github.com/LarsGullik>`_.

* [Breaking] ``fmt::(s)printf`` now supports formatting of objects of user-defined types
  that provide an overloaded ``std::ostream`` insertion operator (``operator<<``)
  (`#201 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/201>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("The date is %s", Date(2012, 12, 9));

* [Breaking] The ``Buffer`` template is now part of the public API and can be used
  to implement custom memory buffers

  - ``BasicStringRef`` is no longer assumed to be null-terminated

  References to null-terminated strings are now represented by a new class,
  ``BasicCStringRef``.

* Dependency on pthreads introduced by Google Test is now optional
  (`#185 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/185>`_).

* New CMake options ``FMT_DOC``, ``FMT_INSTALL`` and ``FMT_TEST`` to control
  generation of ``doc``, ``install`` and ``test`` targets respectively, on by default
  (`#197 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/197>`_,
  `#198 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/198>`_,

  <http://www.polserver.com/>`_ to the list of notable projects using C++ Format.

* C++ Format now uses MSVC intrinsics for better formatting performance
  (`#115 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/115>`_,
  `#116 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/116>`_,
  `#118 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/118>`_ and
  `#121 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/121>`_).
  Previously these optimizations where only used on GCC and Clang.
  Thanks to `@CarterLi <https://github.com/CarterLi>`_ and
  `@objectx <https://github.com/objectx>`_.

* CMake install target (`#119 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/119>`_).
  Thanks to `@TrentHouliston <https://github.com/TrentHouliston>`_.

  You can now install C++ Format with ``make install`` command.

* Improved `Biicode <http://www.biicode.com/>`_ support
  (`#98 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/98>`_ and
  `#104 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/104>`_). Thanks to
  `@MariadeAnton <https://github.com/MariadeAnton>`_ and
  `@franramirez688 <https://github.com/franramirez688>`_.

* Improved support for building with `Android NDK
  <https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html>`_
  (`#107 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/107>`_).
  Thanks to `@newnon <https://github.com/newnon>`_.
  
  The `android-ndk-example <https://github.com/fmtlib/android-ndk-example>`_
  repository provides and example of using C++ Format with Android NDK:

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmtlib/android-ndk-example/
            master/screenshot.png

* Improved documentation of ``SystemError`` and ``WindowsError``
  (`#54 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/54>`_).

* Various code improvements
  (`#110 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/110>`_,
  `#111 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/111>`_
  `#112 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/112>`_).

1.0.0 - 2015-02-05
------------------

* Add support for a header-only configuration when ``FMT_HEADER_ONLY`` is
  defined before including ``format.h``:

  .. code:: c++

    #define FMT_HEADER_ONLY
    #include "format.h"

* Compute string length in the constructor of ``BasicStringRef``
  instead of the ``size`` method
  (`#79 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/79>`_).
  This eliminates size computation for string literals on reasonable optimizing
  compilers.

* Fix formatting of types with overloaded ``operator <<`` for ``std::wostream``
  (`#86 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/86>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::format(L"The date is {0}", Date(2012, 12, 9));

0.12.0 - 2014-10-25
-------------------

* [Breaking] Improved separation between formatting and buffer management.
  ``Writer`` is now a base class that cannot be instantiated directly.
  The new ``MemoryWriter`` class implements the default buffer management
  with small allocations done on stack. So ``fmt::Writer`` should be replaced
  with ``fmt::MemoryWriter`` in variable declarations.

  Old code:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::Writer w;

  New code: 

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::MemoryWriter w;

  If you pass ``fmt::Writer`` by reference, you can continue to do so:

  .. code:: c++

      void f(fmt::Writer &w);

  This doesn't affect the formatting API.

* Support for custom memory allocators
  (`#69 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/69>`_)

* Formatting functions now accept `signed char` and `unsigned char` strings as
  arguments (`#73 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/73>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    auto s = format("GLSL version: {}", glGetString(GL_VERSION));

* Reduced code bloat. According to the new `benchmark results
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt#compile-time-and-code-bloat>`_,
  cppformat is close to ``printf`` and by the order of magnitude better than
  Boost Format in terms of compiled code size.

* Improved appearance of the documentation on mobile by using the `Sphinx
  Bootstrap theme <http://ryan-roemer.github.io/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/>`_:

0.11.0 - 2014-08-21
-------------------

* Safe printf implementation with a POSIX extension for positional arguments:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("Elapsed time: %.2f seconds", 1.23);
    fmt::printf("%1$s, %3$d %2$s", weekday, month, day);

* Arguments of ``char`` type can now be formatted as integers
  (Issue `#55 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/55>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::format("0x{0:02X}", 'a');

* Deprecated parts of the API removed.

* The library is now built and tested on MinGW with Appveyor in addition to
  existing test platforms Linux/GCC, OS X/Clang, Windows/MSVC.

0.10.0 - 2014-07-01
-------------------

**Improved API**

* All formatting methods are now implemented as variadic functions instead
  of using ``operator<<`` for feeding arbitrary arguments into a temporary
  formatter object. This works both with C++11 where variadic templates are
  used and with older standards where variadic functions are emulated by
  providing lightweight wrapper functions defined with the ``FMT_VARIADIC``
  macro. You can use this macro for defining your own portable variadic
  functions:

  .. code:: c++

    void report_error(const char *format, const fmt::ArgList &args) {
      fmt::print("Error: {}");
      fmt::print(format, args);
    }
    FMT_VARIADIC(void, report_error, const char *)

    report_error("file not found: {}", path);

  Apart from a more natural syntax, this also improves performance as there
  is no need to construct temporary formatter objects and control arguments'
  lifetimes. Because the wrapper functions are very lightweight, this doesn't
  cause code bloat even in pre-C++11 mode.

* Simplified common case of formatting an ``std::string``. Now it requires a
  single function call:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = format("The answer is {}.", 42);

  Previously it required 2 function calls:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = str(Format("The answer is {}.") << 42);

  Instead of unsafe ``c_str`` function, ``fmt::Writer`` should be used directly
  to bypass creation of ``std::string``:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::Writer w;
    w.write("The answer is {}.", 42);
    w.c_str();  // returns a C string

  This doesn't do dynamic memory allocation for small strings and is less error
  prone as the lifetime of the string is the same as for ``std::string::c_str``
  which is well understood (hopefully).

* Improved consistency in naming functions that are a part of the public API.
  Now all public functions are lowercase following the standard library
  conventions. Previously it was a combination of lowercase and
  CapitalizedWords.
  Issue `#50 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/50>`_.

* Old functions are marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next
  release.

**Other Changes**

* Experimental support for printf format specifications (work in progress):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("The answer is %d.", 42);
    std::string s = fmt::sprintf("Look, a %s!", "string");

* Support for hexadecimal floating point format specifiers ``a`` and ``A``:

  .. code:: c++

    print("{:a}", -42.0); // Prints -0x1.5p+5
    print("{:A}", -42.0); // Prints -0X1.5P+5

* CMake option ``FMT_SHARED`` that specifies whether to build format as a
  shared library (off by default).

0.9.0 - 2014-05-13
------------------

* More efficient implementation of variadic formatting functions.

* ``Writer::Format`` now has a variadic overload:

  .. code:: c++

    Writer out;
    out.Format("Look, I'm {}!", "variadic");

* For efficiency and consistency with other overloads, variadic overload of
  the ``Format`` function now returns ``Writer`` instead of ``std::string``.
  Use the ``str`` function to convert it to ``std::string``:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = str(Format("Look, I'm {}!", "variadic"));

* Replaced formatter actions with output sinks: ``NoAction`` -> ``NullSink``,
  ``Write`` -> ``FileSink``, ``ColorWriter`` -> ``ANSITerminalSink``.
  This improves naming consistency and shouldn't affect client code unless
  these classes are used directly which should be rarely needed.

* Added ``ThrowSystemError`` function that formats a message and throws
  ``SystemError`` containing the formatted message and system-specific error
  description. For example, the following code

  .. code:: c++

    FILE *f = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!f)
      ThrowSystemError(errno, "Failed to open file '{}'") << filename;

  will throw ``SystemError`` exception with description
  "Failed to open file '<filename>': No such file or directory" if file
  doesn't exist.

* Support for AppVeyor continuous integration platform.

* ``Format`` now throws ``SystemError`` in case of I/O errors.

* Improve test infrastructure. Print functions are now tested by redirecting
  the output to a pipe.

0.8.0 - 2014-04-14
------------------

* Initial release
