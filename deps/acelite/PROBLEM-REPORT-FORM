[Please use the PRF form below to submit bug reports, problem reports,
 etc., to the ACE developers and interested users.  Send it to
 ace-bugs@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu, you must be subscribed to the list
 in order to be able to post to it. If you are using OCI, MicroFocus, or
 Riverace's versions of ACE do not send bugs to this mailing list, but
 instead contact those companies for support.  Please also send your
 PRF as plain ASCII text, _not_ uuencoded or as an attachment.

 We prefer that all bug reports be submitted through github issues.
 See https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/issues for more information
 about how to do this.  If you are unsure as to whether your problem
 is a real bug or not then please submit your question to the mailing
 list using the following form.  Not using the problem report form
 will make it harder or impossible to identify the problem, and in
 many cases we will be unable to help at all.  Also please try to
 browse the existing github isssues and the ChangeLog files to find
 out if your problem has been solved in a more recent version of ACE.

 To subscribe to the list see

 Replace/remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.

 Please send this form as ASCII text only.  Do _not_ send it as an
 attachment, or as tar'ed, compressed and/or uuencoded text.  And
 limit line lengths to less than 80 characters.

 PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
 Subjects like "ACE bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!
 Also, do _not_ include the word "help" in the Subject!]

 When including your config.h and platform_macros.GNU files as requested
 below, only include the contents if you use the recommended method of
 including the platform-specific file in your file. If you use a link
 to the platform-specific file, simply state which one - DO NOT
 include an entire platform-specific configuration file in the form.
