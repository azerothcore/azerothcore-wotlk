## Reporting a Vulnerability

We class a vulnerability to be any hack or exploit that has an impact on the server performance or that gives unfair advantages in the game (e.g fly hacking or injection tools).

If a new vulnerability is found you should always create a new [bug report](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/issues/new/choose).
