# Run AzerothCore with Docker

*This readme it's a summary of the AzerothCore docker features.*

Docker. is a software that performs operating-system-level virtualization, allowing to wrap and launch applications inside containers.

Thanks to Docker, you can quickly setup and run AzerothCore in any operating system.

The **only** requirement is having [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed into your system. Forget about installing mysql, visual studio, cmake, etc...

### Installation instructions

Check the [Install with Docker](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/Install-with-Docker) guide.

The total amount of RAM when running all AzerothCore docker containers is **less than 2 GB**.
