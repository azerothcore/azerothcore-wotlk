### Changed
- New options for loading scripts `static dynamic minimal-static minimal-dynamic` (#5346)
```
static - Build statically. Default option. for all scripts (As it was before)
dynamic - Build dynamically. After start support Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) can make separated library for each script. Now don't support
minimal-static - builds commands and spells statically
minimal-dynamic - builds commands and spells dynamically. Now don't support
```
- Also the default value which is provided by the `SCRIPTS` variable is overwriteable through the `SCRIPTS_COMMANDS, SCRIPTS_SPELLS...` variable.
- Each subdirectory contains it's own translation unit now which is responsible for loading it's directory
- If module using deprecated script loader api, you get error message.
```cmake
> Module (mod-ah-bot) using deprecated loader api
```

### How to upgrade
- For most modules, the `CMakeLists.txt' file is no longer needed
- Need change script loader file.
```
1. Rename extension in file to `.cpp`
2. Rename general loading function to `Add(module name with replace all whitespace to '_')Scripts()`.
3. Delete macros `AC_ADD_SCRIPT_LOADER` from `CMakeLists.txt`
```
- Example loader script for modules:
```cpp

// Add all scripts
