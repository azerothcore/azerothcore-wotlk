/**
 * @file ServerMailMgr.h
 * @brief Manages the ServerMail operations, including template loading, condition checking, and mail delivery.
 *
 * This class handles the loading of server mail templates, associated items, and conditions from the database.
 * It also provides functionality to check player eligibility for receiving server mails based on configured conditions.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Supports multi-item mails via `mail_server_template_items`
 * - Supports flexible mail conditions (level, playtime, quest, achievement) via `mail_server_template_conditions`
 * - Ensures all related data is loaded and validated on startup
