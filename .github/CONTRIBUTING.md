## CONTRIBUTING

AzerothCore is a learning project, and there are lots of different ways to contribute to the project:

* By [testing our fixes](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/How-to-test-a-PR) (we can teach you how to correctly use Git to help us but that will also help you out tremendously)
* By developing directly to the core or the modules
* By reporting bugs within the project
* By [creating new modules](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/Create-a-Module)
* By improving our wiki
* By providing direct support to our community (on discord, StackOverflow or specialized forums)
* By making extra content (video tutorial for example)
* By putting bounties on issues

If you want to contribute to the project, you will find a lot of resources that will guide you in our wiki.
