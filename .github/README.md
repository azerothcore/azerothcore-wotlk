## INTRODUCTION

AzerothCore (AC) is an open-source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.

It is written in C++ and is based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.


## WHY AZEROTHCORE?

1. Stability
1. The authenticity of the content
1. [Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
1. A lot of modules to choose from
1. Better configuration files system
1. Compatibility with other emulators
1. Friendly and helpful community

#### Stability

As players and administrators ourselves, we take great care into the stability of our core. Other projects focus on the development side of things and tend to forget that users want stability above everything else.

Hence why nobody is allowed to push commits directly to the core. All changes are reviewed and tested before they get to the `master` branch which means we need as many testers as possible to avoid stalling issues.

#### Authenticity

Fixing and implementing missing blizzlike content is one of our priorities, and we can boast to offer the most content-complete open-source emulator.
<!-- Not sure for this below -->
<!-- We were the first open-source emulator to have almost every dungeon and raid working. -->

#### Modules

Modules are essential to AzerothCore's success. Modules allow users to plug them in and out easily, and do not require to modify the core files. It also means users can keep pulling the git changes from the main repository and only develop their modules.

We have a lot of modules already made, some of them are very important and will ease your work:

* [Transmogrification](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-transmog)
* [Eluna (lua engine) support](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna-lua-engine/ "Creator of Eluna is part of our core team")
* Full list available in the AzerothCore catalogue (link at the end)

#### Configuration files

Our configuration file system allows the user to use a tiny configuration file for better readability and maintenance.

#### Compatibility with other emulators

Not very far from its ancestor TrinityCore, most scripts can be adapted quite easily. For MaNGOS compatibility, it might require more knowledge but it shares a common base.


## PHILOSOPHY

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience.

Here are the main points we focus on:

* Stability
* Ease of use / Practicability
* Playability (in-game content)
* Customization
* Community-driven software (check our discord)

We also welcome new users (even non-English speaking users!) and help them learn/improve their skills (C++, SQL, Git, software collaboration, tutoring/wiki, etc...).

Unlike other projects which focus more on the developer's side of things, we want users to be able to run their server with as few troubles as possible. All of our contributors run their private servers (local or public).

That's why AzerothCore is easier to use, to maintain, to understand, to develop on, and to customize to suit your needs, than other emulators.

In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**, whether it be the **player's experience**, the **developer's experience**, or the **administrator's experience**.
